# Fear_Generalization
Translation in Python + PyMC of the R project at https://osf.io/sxjak/.

The fitting results files are not present because they exceeded GitHub file limit.

The report pdf is in the Report directory.

All the code is commented and an explanation of every part of the code is also present in the report.

To run the models needed for the Analysis and the Simulation one can just run run_pymc.

The PyMC models are in the model_definitions module.

(The analysis code in the Analysis folder, the data processing in Data_Processing (original repository rds file needed), 
the code for the simulation is in the Simulation folder.)

The code to generate the simulated dataset is in the Simulation/simulation_2 module, but the dataset is already present.
